# Richa Shah Individual Project 

This project will create a data-driven Java website which will provide apartment management features
to tenant.

### Problem Statement 
Do you have to go to rental office/owner to drop off your check every month, or have to get a money order
to pay the rent? Or you were ever put on hold when calling for maintenance request? If you want to avoid
doing these manual works and looking for convenient ways to do these, I am creating a website which will
meet your requirements.

You will be able to pay the rent, view payment history, and submit maintenance request through this website,
all these services will be at your fingertips.
